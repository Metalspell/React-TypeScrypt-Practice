          It's quite a long and confusing story.
          When I was at university, I never thought of linking my destiny with programming. I was full of railway romance and, like my father, wanted to become a railway engineer. In those days it was quite a prestigious profession. However, my ideas about my future job and the reality turned out to be so striking that all romance quickly faded away. Nevertheless, I decided to keep working and build my career. Over time, I began to realize that all my efforts were of no use to anyone, I was not doing what I loved, and I had reached a ceiling in my development, which prompted me to look for another way of life. However, I didn't know what to do. One day my friend, a Ruby programmer, said to me, "Stop whining! Get into programming!" I wasn't at all sure this was what I wanted to do with my life, but I decided to give it a try.
          My first teacher was Codeacademy. After taking a few courses there on HTML, CSS, and JS, I realized that I loved it. And I want more.
          I signed up for a Front-End Pro course at a local Hillel school, where I got a more thorough introduction to Frontend development. I finished the course with an A. I felt it wasn't enough for a real job. So after talking to a friend of mine, I decided to practice a bit and under his strict guidance, I started doing front-end for his personal website. At the end I was very proud of myself, because for a beginner it turned out very cool.
          After that, Pavel Yakovenko - engineer at SoftRequest - found me on ginny. He offered to join a team (TechMANGO) that will develop a website for his personal project - online poker, which he has been developing since his student days.
          However, the war in the country has made its changes. Unfortunately, the foreign investor decided to leave us and we had to say goodbye. Now, in spite of everything, I am looking for a team where I could realize myself and grow as an engineer.
